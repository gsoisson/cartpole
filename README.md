# A Deep RL Solution To The CartPole Environment In Gym

The goal of this project is to solve the CartPole environment in Gym using Deep Reinforcement Learning. We first modify the environment to add an action that does nothing, then implement a deep Q-learning with experience replay solution. Finally, we study the impact on the learning process of adding a cost to the two actions that move the cart.
